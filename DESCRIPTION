Description: If translate English words into Chinese, you might consider 
    looking up a dictionary or online query, in fact, there is a faster 
    way for R user. Ke-Hao Wu (2014) <RYoudaoTranslate: R package provide 
    functions to translate English words into Chinese.> provides interface 
    to Youdao translation open API for R user. But this software is not 
    very friendly to use, I have made some improvements on the basis of 
    this software. You can pass in a words or a vector consisting of multiple 
    words, which will return the corresponding type of Chinese representation 
    and be easy to reuse.
