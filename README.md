If translate English words into Chinese, you might consider looking 
up a dictionary or online query, in fact, there is a faster way for 
R user. Ke-Hao Wu (2014) <RYoudaoTranslate: R package provide functions 
to translate English words into Chinese.> provides interface to Youdao 
translation open API for R user. But this software is not very friendly 
to use, I have made some improvements on the basis of this software. 
You can pass in a words or a vector consisting of multiple words, which 
will return the corresponding type of Chinese representation and be easy 
to reuse.
